# Reflection

This was the first project I did that helped me begin to understand arrays. I learned how to randomize numbers into an array that would match with a word in the beale word list. To revise this project I added a function to generate a new password when a key is pressed, and I also improved the style of the display. I also added in some more documentation in the code. 

After this project I have used KeyPressed in pretty much all of my Repl projects and have a better understanding of how to implement it, so I wanted to return to this project and add it in. I think just this one funtion makes the program much more user friendly.

Since this project I have also learned a lot more about how to style your program, so I wanted to return to this project and make it look prettier by adding the outlined box.
